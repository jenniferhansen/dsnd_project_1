## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.6.3.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This is one of my first data science projects. I want to use it to apply the CRISP-DM process on a dataset, do some data wrangling (e.g. working with categorical data and NaNs), ask some business questions and answer them.

For this project I used Netflix data from 2019. The questions I asked were:

1. How much of the content on Netflix is family/children friendly?
2. Which genre movie or show is most common?
3. Which actor is popular on Netflix/ has the most shows/movies on Netflix?
4. Is duration correlated with release date? Does the release date predict the duration (movies)?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

This repo contains three files:
- netflix_titles.csv
- Project_1.ipynb
- README.md
Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  


## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://www.medium.com).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The dataset was publicly available on kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows
The link also contains a description of the dataset.
Feel free to use my code for further analysis!
Thank you :)
